## Valley of disappointment

New habits take time to show expected results

## Habits are Process oriented, based from our Identity. Outcomes follow.

A habit is nothing but a routine or a practice performed regularly. But not all routines are habits. Any routine that is Goal/Outcome oriented will last only until the goal is acheived. 
Whereas that routine which is process oriented and votes for your identity, will last forever. Hence creating the habits.

#### Two step process to make your habit last forever
1. Decide the type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins regularly

## The four laws of behaviour change

--- | How to create a good habit |
--- | --- |
1st law (Cue) | Make is obvious |
2nd law (Craving) | Make it attractive |
3rd law (Response) | Make it easy |
4th law (Reward) | Make it satisfying |


--- | How to break a bad habit |
--- | --- |
Inversion of 1st law (Cue) | Make is invisible |
Inversion of 2nd law (Craving) | Make it unattractive |
Inversion of 3rd law (Response) | Make it difficult |
Inversion of 4th law (Reward) | Make it unsatisfying |

## Make it obvious

### Technique 1: Being specific

While trying to form a new habit, Try to be as specific as possible with the details. For example, Be clear on `time`, `location`, `duration`, `reps`... of the activity

### Technique 2: Habit stacking

Group activities together and perform them one after the other. This will gradually reduce load on your brain in thinking what to do next.

### Technique 3: Environment priming

Set the environment around you that is condusive for the activity. Plant Cues around that help as triggers for the activity. Reduce `Friction` that may make the activity difficult.

> Motivation and Willpower are overrated. Environment often matters more

In case you are trying to break an habit, Make the Cues or Triggers invisible. Add `Friction` to the activity so that it becomes less interesting to start.

> People with "high self control" tend to spend less time in the tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
